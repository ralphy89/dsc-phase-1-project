    "### 📌 Project Overview\n",
    "As part of its expansion strategy, our company is exploring entry into the aviation sector by acquiring aircraft for commercial and private use. However, the leadership team has limited knowledge of the operational and safety risks associated with different types of aircraft.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to leverage historical aviation accident data to help identify **which aircraft types pose the lowest risk**, enabling the business to make **data-driven decisions** about its initial investments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Business Objective\n",
    "The goal is to analyze patterns in aviation accidents from 1962 to 2023 to:\n",
    "- Identify key factors contributing to aircraft risk,\n",
    "- Determine which aircraft types are historically safest,\n",
    "- Deliver **three concrete recommendations** for which aircraft the company should prioritize for purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final output will support the **head of the aviation division** with strategic insights to inform acquisition decisions.\n",

    "## 2. Audience & Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is intended for a **technical data science audience** and outlines the full analytical process using Python and Markdown. The results will be presented separately in a non-technical format for business stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 👣 Project Steps:\n",
    "1. **Data Understanding** — Explore and understand the dataset structure and content  \n",
    "2. **Data Preparation** — Clean, transform, and engineer relevant features  \n",
    "3. **Data Analysis** — Visualize trends, compare aircraft categories, and assess risk  \n",
    "4. **Recommendations** — Deliver insights with business impact\n",
